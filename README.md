# Hex Game

Hex Game is a turn-based strategy game played on a hexagonal map. Two players control opposite sides of the board, place and move units, and attack neighboring enemy territories to expand control.

Each match includes varied terrain (such as rivers and mountains), creating positional choices and tradeoffs. The objective is to outmaneuver the opponent and dominate more of the map over the course of the game.
